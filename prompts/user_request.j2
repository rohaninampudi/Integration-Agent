## Available Workflow Variables
{% for key, value in variables.items() %}
- {{ key }}: {{ value | tojson }}
{% endfor %}

## Required Output Format
After using the tools to select an action and retrieve API docs, respond with a JSON object:

  "selected_action": "<action_id>",
  "reasoning": "<explanation of why this action was selected and how the config was generated>",
  "proposed_config": "<liquid template string that renders to valid JSON>"
}
```

Important:
- The `proposed_config` must be a STRING containing Liquid template syntax
